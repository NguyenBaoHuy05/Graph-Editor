# Graph Editor

## About
A C# Windows Forms application that simulates and visualizes graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A*, Prim, and Kruskal. Users can create graphs, view real-time algorithm execution, and interact with a user-friendly interface for educational purposes.

## Features
Visualize common graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A*, Prim, Kruskal).
Create and edit graphs using drag-and-drop functionality.
Assign weights to edges and observe algorithm steps in real-time.
Step through algorithms with clear visual indicators for each state.
Intuitive, easy-to-use interface suitable for learning and research.

## Usage
Launch the application.
Use the drag-and-drop interface to add vertices and edges.
Assign weights to edges if needed.
Select an algorithm and start the execution to visualize the process.
